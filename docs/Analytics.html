      <hr>
      <p id = "analyticsfont">Our team is dedicated to progression so we've decided to keep track of skills we would like to further develop in the MSIS program. All of the skills are tied into each other and if we are lacking in one area, it will affect the others. Therefore, it's important to our group to keep everyone progressing. Each of these skills will be monitored over the course of our semester.
      The scores aren't tied to our performance but rather the importance we felt of each individual skill, at that moment in time.</p>

      <p id = "analyticsSmallFont"> The MSIS program is a technical program so we don't want to lose track of developing our soft skills. These skills could ultimately be what puts us ahead of our peers in terms of job positions.
      It became incredibly evident to use midway througout the semester that communication is an absolute priority for our group to succeed.
    This is evident in our Mid-Semester graph along with our Ending Weeks. We learned that a group is only as strong as their communication.</p>

     <p id = "analyticsSmallFont"> We will be working with our teams throughout the entire semester and in order for us to succeed we need to have strong team skills. Many of these skills deal with leading, a skill many of us have not practiced, so we will be targetting that primarily.
     Our team primarilly focused on Task Ownership, however, we felt like we could've focused more on Time Management. We were in survival mode so it felt like Time Management was never our focus.</p>

    <p id = "analyticsSmallFont"> Developing our technical skills is a large priority for our group. We understand that programming is essential in the future. Developing our technical skills is a large reason behind our enrollment in the MSIS program.
    Near the end of our semester our entire team realized the importance of the technical presenting skill. To be succesfull in the business world you need to be able to present your ideas to either higher ups or even potential clients.

    <br>
    <p id = "analyticsSmallFont"> Interpersonal skills play a crucial part in our group dynamic. We come from all different cultures so it's important to understand what non-verbals we may be giving off depending on who we are approaching. Our diverse groups gives us a perfect opportunity to develop these skills.
    One of our strongest skills as a group was our ability to actively listen to each other. This was clearly an emphasis for everyone and really distinguished our groups from others.</p>

      Our team faced alot of hardships together right around the ERP simulation time. This stressed our team to the max but eventually overcame and saw our team chemistry even better after releasing our feelings.
      It took our team a long time to hit the norming and then finally performing phase, but we eventually did it within the last month of the semester.
